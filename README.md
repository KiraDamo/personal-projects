#Kira's Data Science Projects

Welcome to my personal data science portfolio!

In these projects I apply data science to some of the things I love most such as K-pop, gaming, and social media trends. I look forward to approaching my interests in a new light by combining creativity and analytics to answer questions, unveil patterns, and practice skills I am developing in Python, R, and visualization.
