Welcome to My Personal Portfolio 

Hi! I'm Kira! I graduated from DePaul with a Bachelor's of Science in Physics with a minor in mathematics and now I'm currently pursuing my Master's degree in Data Science at DePaul University. In these projects I intersect my passion for gaming, music, and social media with my increasing knowledge and expertise in data analysis and visualization.
