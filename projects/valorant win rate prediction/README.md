## Valorant Win Rate Prediction

In this Project, I gather the match stats of two of my friends to investigate which variable contributes the most to the win rate of their matches. Maybe this will help me figure out what I need to work on to finally rank up in this game as well.

Both players, as of December 2nd, 2025 are Ascendant 1. With this data I also want to do a friendly competition of who will theoretically rank up first? Raisu, who ranked up from platinum to ascendant in the span of 1 month, or Ace, who has been seesawing between diamond and ascendant.

The data is confined to their first 50 competitive matches of V25:A6. All points are manually entered from me since tracker.gg does NOT allow scraping.
*My match data does not take into account duo, trio, or fivestacking*
*My match data also does not account for servers which can affect ping performance*

If you find this project and would like to see riveting Valorant gameplay,
please follow my friends on Twitch who graciously allowed me to do my project on their stats!
