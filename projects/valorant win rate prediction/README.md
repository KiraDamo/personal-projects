##Valorant Win Rate Prediction

In this Project, I gather the matches of two of my friends to predict which variable contributes the most to the win rate of their matches.

The data is confined to ONLY competitive matches in V25:A6. All points are manually entered from me since tracker.gg does NOT allow scraping.
*Matches do not take into account duo, trio, or fivestacking.*

Whoever finds this project and would like to see riveting Valorant gameplay,
please follow my friends on Twitch!
